## Welcome to the World Bank's FCV Data Collection Tutorials

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Gabe-Levin/FCV_DataCollectionTutorials/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Mobile

<button name="button" onclick="http://www.google.com" style="width:75%;padding:16px 32px;font-size: 16px; box-shadow: 0 8px 16px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.19);">Click me</button>

```markdown

### Drones

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Gabe-Levin/FCV_DataCollectionTutorials/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
